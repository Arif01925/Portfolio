    "title": "CHOFFEE – Instant Chickpea Coffee Alternative",
    "description": "This packaging design was created for CHOFFEE, an innovative chickpea-based coffee alternative targeting health-conscious consumers seeking a caffeine-free option. The project involved designing a visually appealing and informative pouch that could stand out on retail shelves while reflecting the warmth and comfort associated with a traditional coffee experience.\r\n\r\nThe design features a smooth gradient of warm hues and a subtle geometric pattern to convey both natural simplicity and premium quality. A realistic cup of the brewed product is showcased alongside chickpeas to clearly communicate the core ingredient. Key product benefits and preparation instructions are thoughtfully placed to ensure clarity for first-time buyers.\r\n\r\nThis mockup was developed to visualize the final product for marketing and presentation purposes. The concept balances modern branding with a clean, functional layout — ready for both print and digital use.",

    "title": "NutriGout Plus – Supplement Bottle Design",
    "description": "NutriGout Plus is a dietary supplement created to support individuals managing gout-related issues. The goal of this packaging design was to communicate trust, cleanliness, and clinical quality while staying true to the health supplement market.\r\n\r\nThe clean white bottle background emphasizes purity and safety, while the green tones reflect natural ingredients and wellness. The branding combines medical professionalism (through the cross icon and structured font) with subtle organic cues (via the foot icon and soft green palette). Important product details like \"750 mg,\" \"GMP Certified,\" and \"Made in the USA\" are prominently placed to reinforce credibility and transparency for consumers.\r\n\r\nThis 60-capsule vegetarian supplement bottle mockup is ideal for digital marketing, online store listings, and investor presentations.",

    "title": "ClearMed™ Hemorrhoid Treatment – Supplement Label",
    "description": "This project features the complete packaging and product visualization for ClearMed™ Hemorrhoid Treatment, a dietary supplement aimed at relief and prevention of hemorrhoids. The product is presented in two variants: Mild Strength (45 capsules) and Extra Strength (90 capsules).\r\n\r\nThe design goal was to create a clean, clinical, and trustworthy aesthetic while using color and layout to clearly distinguish product strength and instructions. The branding utilizes calming tones of purple and magenta, symbolizing both care and wellness. Each label is optimized for FDA-compliant supplement packaging, including Supplement Facts, dosage directions, cautions, and contact information.\r\n\r\nFor visual storytelling, a series of realistic mockups were created featuring front, angled, and side views. These mockups showcase the bottle in soft studio lighting and pastel-toned environments to highlight the professionalism and clarity of the design. The layout is designed to stand out both in retail settings and on digital platforms.\r\n\r\nThis work demonstrates my ability to design effective health supplement packaging from concept to final visualization, suitable for both online listings and investor presentations.",
